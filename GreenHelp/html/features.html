<br></ul><hr><a name='*Collapse a Class Box'><b>*Collapse a Class Box</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
To perform this function, select a type and press 
the <i>c</i> key. The size of the box will instantly be set to a size 
specified in the preferences system.

<hr><a name='*Filters'><b>*Filters</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
Filters can be added to prevent certain things 
from being displayed in the diagram. Types, fields, and methods can 
be filtered by their visibility and name. Note that all names are 
fully-qualified. Filters apply to all editors simultaneously.
<hr><a name='*Invisible grid'><b>*Invisible grid</b></a> (Preferences System)<br><br>
The invisible grid causes UML boxes to snap to the 
editor at a certain number of pixels. You can change this value in the 
preferences system. Setting the value to 1 effectively disables this 
feature.
<hr><a name='*Manhattan routing'><b>*Manhattan routing</b></a> (Preferences System)<br><br>
To enable Manhattan routing, use the preferences 
system. Manhattan routing takes much of the drudgery out of adding 
bendpoints to a diagram, but limits the control you have over the 
drawing of arcs.
<hr><a name='*Show subtype names on relationship arcs'><b>*Show subtype names on relationship arcs</b></a> (Preferences System)<br><br>

Relationship subtype names are automatically places 
on relationship arcs, if subtypes exist. This can be disabled in the 
preferences system.
<hr><a name='*Tooltips'><b>*Tooltips</b></a> (Preferences System)<br><br>
While hovering over a member (class, field, or 
method), a tooltip will be displayed, offering you either a list of 
quick fixes or a javadoc. The javadoc will only be offered if it exists 
and there are no suggestions for a quick fix.
<hr><a name='Add an element to a type'><b>Add an element to a type</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
You can use the dialog box to select modifiers for 
the field or method being added.<br><br>Note: This action cannot be 
undone using the undo feature.
<hr><a name='Alter global relationship visibility'><b>Alter global relationship visibility</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
This feature will unconditionally hide or show all 
relationships of the given kind. If you activate <i>show all 
relationships</i>, relationships that are globally hidden will not be 
shown.

<hr><a name='Delete'><b>Delete</b></a> (Integrated)<br><br>
To delete something from the editor (and code), 
use the <i>Delete</i> key. Be careful when using this feature; you are 
capable of removing large sections of code. This feature can be undone 
if performed on a note, but cannot be undone for anything else. You 
cannot delete binary types loaded into the diagram; if you wish to 
remove these, use the <i>remove from diagram</i> action on the type.
<hr><a name='Draw UML boxes to create a class'><b>Draw UML boxes to create a class</b></a> (Palette)<br><br>
When a UML box is drawn, the respective class or 
interface is automatically created in Eclipse. The standard <i>New Java 
Class</i> dialog appears, allowing you to fill in the class name, 
superclasses, implemented interfaces, and so forth. After the class is 
generated, the UML box is displayed at the location where you dragged 
it.

<hr><a name='Draw a note'><b>Draw a note</b></a> (Palette)<br><br>
A note can be drawn directly in the editor, and 
its contents can be changed by double-clicking on it. Notes are saved 
along with the rest of the contents of the editor. They are selectable 
and resizable. Their contents are stored only in the diagram file and 
are not referenced anywhere in the Java code.
<hr><a name='Draw a relationship'><b>Draw a relationship</b></a> (Palette)<br><br>
After creating UML boxes. Select one of the 
relationship tools. Then, select the source and destination UML boxes to 
create a relationship between them. Green will automatically generate 
the necessary code to create the selected relationship.
<hr><a name='Generate a UML diagram from existing code'><b>Generate a UML diagram from existing code</b></a> (Package Explorer Context Menu)<br><br>
Simply right-click a java file, package, or 
project and then select <i>Open in UML Diagram</i> to create a diagram 
containing its contents. Green automatically draws in any relationships 
that are recognized in your existing code.

<hr><a name='Incrementally explore'><b>Incrementally explore</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
Activating this feature performs a complex 
operation. First, it looks for all relationships that stem from this 
type (i.e. this is the source of the relationship, not the target). It 
then proceeds to look at the targets of those relationships and load 
them into the editor one by one. The relationships between the explored 
class and its targets are then drawn into the diagram.
<hr><a name='Open a Java element'><b>Open a Java element</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
To open an element, right-click on it in the 
package explorer and select <i>Open in UML class diagram</i>.
<hr><a name='Open a call hierarchy'><b>Open a call hierarchy</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
This action will open the view that shows the 
methods that call the selected method.

<hr><a name='Open a type hierarchy'><b>Open a type hierarchy</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
This action will open the view that shows the 
subclasses of a type.
<hr><a name='Print a diagram'><b>Print a diagram</b></a> (Integrated)<br><br>
Simply go to Print in the file menu.
<hr><a name='Refactor a method signature'><b>Refactor a method signature</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
This feature allows you to change the name, 
modifier, and parameters of a method and will update all calls to the 
method.<br><br>Note: This action cannot be undone using the undo 
feature.
<hr><a name='Refactor: move'><b>Refactor: move</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>

This feature will move a field, method, or type 
from one Java file to another. All references to the field, method, or 
type will be updated.<br><br>Note: This action cannot be undone using 
the undo feature. If you move a type with the same name as the java file 
it is in, everything inside that type will be moved.
<hr><a name='Refactor: rename'><b>Refactor: rename</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
This feature renames a field, method, or type. All 
references to the field, method, or type will be updated.<br><br>Note: 
This action cannot be undone using the undo feature. If you rename a 
type with the same name as the java file it is in, the java file will be 
renamed as well.
<hr><a name='Refresh the editor'><b>Refresh the editor</b></a> (Integrated)<br><br>
To refresh the editor, press the <i>F5</i> key.
<hr><a name='Remove a type from the diagram'><b>Remove a type from the diagram</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>

If you want to remove a type from the diagram, 
select it and press the <i>Backspace</i> key. Alternatively, you can use 
the context menu to remove a type from the diagram.<br><br>Note: 
Removing a type from the diagram does not remove it from your file 
system. To remove a file from your project, use the delete function.
<hr><a name='Save a diagram as a JPEG'><b>Save a diagram as a JPEG</b></a> (Integrated)<br><br>
Simply go to Save As in the file menu and change 
the save format to JPEG.
<hr><a name='Toggle method visibility'><b>Toggle method visibility</b></a> (Preferences System)<br><br>
You can hide all non-public methods. This could be 
useful if you were trying to view the methods that are accessible from 
all types.
<hr><a name='Toggle type name'><b>Toggle type name</b></a> (Preferences System)<br><br>

You can display either simple names or 
fully-qualified names in the diagram.
<hr><a name='Undo/Redo'><b>Undo/Redo</b></a> (Integrated)<br><br>
Simply access these actions from the edit menu. 
The shortcut keys also work.
<hr><a name='Use auto-resize for a type'><b>Use auto-resize for a type</b></a> (Context Menu)<br><br>
When you resize a type box, the size becomes fixed 
at that size. Activating this feature will cause the box to 
automatically resize to show its entire contents.
