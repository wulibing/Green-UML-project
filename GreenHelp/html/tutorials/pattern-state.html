<b><font size="+1">Setting up Eclipse and Green for our example</font></b>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To begin, you need to download the source code for the State Pattern example. 
The location will be provided by Dr. Alphonce. Right-click in the &quot;Package 
Explorer&quot; view and select &quot;Import...". Select &quot;Existing Projects 
into Workspace&quot; and click &quot;Next&quot;, then choose &quot;
Select archive file&quot; and use &quot;Browse&quot; to locate the archive. 
Select &quot;Finish&quot; in the &quot;Import&quot; window when you've found the 
archive.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Find the file &quot;TrafficLight.dia&quot; and double-click it to open the 
diagram in the editor.

    <b><font size="+1">State Design Pattern</font></b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The best way to describe the state design pattern is by describing a 
    behavior we all (should) know. A simple traffic light is shown to the left. 
    In it, we see two lamps, one on top (Red, or STOP) and one on the bottom 
    (Green, or GO.) The light thus has two separate "states": a "red" state and 
    a "green" state. Determination of which state comes next will be 
    <i>delegated</i> to the states.<br>

  <br><b><font size="+1">How state works</font></b>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The "State" design pattern relies on an arbitary number of objects that 
  represent the states our main object can have. In our case, the main object is 
  called "TrafficLight". Our states will share a common interface, which we will 
  call "ILampState". That interface will define the methods that our states 
  will have in common.
</table>


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One behavior a traffic light is responsible for is displaying the current color 
of the light. Another is the ability to change from one color to another. 
Double-click on the getColor() method in the diagram inside the "TrafficLight" 
box. Change the code inside that method to match the following:<br><br>

<table style="width: 100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody>
  <tr><td style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">
    <font color="6633FF">public</font> Color getColor() {
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <font color="#6633FF">return</font> _myState.getColor();<br>}
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notice that the method refers to the variable "_myState", which will be the 
class' "current state". The TrafficLight class <i>delegates</i> to its states to 
return what "state" it is currently in. Since all the states share a common 
interface (ILampState), the method <code>getColor()</code> is guaranteed to be 
present for all of the <i>implementations</i> of the states. Close the code 
window.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right-click on TrafficLight, go to <i>Add -&gt; AddField</i>. For the name, use 
<i>_myState</i>. For the type, use <i>ILampState</i>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Select the "Interface" tool in the tool pane, then click anywhere on the white 
space in the UML diagram area to create the interface.</td> Name it "ILampState" 
and press "Finish".

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now our diagram has one class (TrafficLight) and one interface for all states to 
implement (<code>ILampState</code>). We now need to begin defining the methods 
which our Lamp States must implement. Ask yourself the following: "What does a 
lamp state need to do?"

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As we illustrated at the beginning of our tutorial, a lamp state must inform us 
what state it is in. It has other responsibilities, but at first, we'll just 
focus on getting the lamp's current color

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recall that we call a method called <code>getColor()</code> that belongs to 
ILampState. Since we're defining the method in the interface first, it doesn't need to have 
a <i>body</i>. When we have <i>concrete implementation</i> of the interface, we 
will define how the "getColor()" method will actually get the color. Interfaces 
provide a set of guaranteed methods that concrete classes will have.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First, we have to add the method to the interface. Right-click on the interface 
"ILampState" in the diagram and select <i>Add -&gt; Add Method</i>. A dialog 
will appear. Name the method <i>getColor</i>. In the Type field, type 
"java.awt.Color" and click "Finish". Double-click the interface class to look at 
the code inside. It should look similar to the following:<br><br>

<table style="width: 100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody>
  <tr><td style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">
    <font color="6633FF">public interface</font> ILampState {
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <font color="6633FF">public</font> java.awt.Color getColor();<br>}
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close the code window. What this method means is that anything that is an 
<i>ILampState</i> must have the ability to do <i>getColor</i>. This method must 
be defined by our concrete classes. We may be able to see what state we're in by 
querying the color, but how do we <i>change</i> states? As mentioned before, we 
have two <i>transitions</i>: Red changes to Green; Green changes to Red. To do 
this in code, we need another method that will tell us what state to go to next. 
Follow the steps above to add another method to the interface, except this time 
you should call the method <i>getNextState</i> and the type <i>ILampState</i>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next step is to provide a way to change from the current state to the next 
state. Double-click the <i>TrafficLight</i> box. A code window should open up. 
Change the <i>changeColor</i> method's code to look like the following:<br><br>

<table style="width: 100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody>
  <tr><td style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">
    <font color="6633FF">public</font> void changeColor() {
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    _myState = _myState.getNextState();<br>}</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close the code window. It's time to begin "realizing" our interface into 
concrete classes that implement our interface. To do this, we first declare the 
classes that will represent the states. They will be called <i>RedState</i> and 
<i>GreenState</i>. Create a class for each one in the diagram.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We'll use Green to cause the classes to implement <i>ILampState</i>. Select the 
<i>realization</i> relationship tool from the palette. <i>Realization</i> is a 
special UML relationship that we use when a class object "implements" an 
interface.

After selecting the realization tool, click on <i>RedState</i> and then <i>
ILampState</i>. A relationship arc should appear. You'll notice that there's a 
problem indicated by a red X in the top left corner of the <i>RedState</i> box.
<br><img src="../img/afterRealization.jpg">

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The <i>selection</i> tool should now be active; after drawing a relationship, 
the palette automatically reverts to the default tool after drawing is 
performed. Double-click on the <i>RedState</i> class to open up the code window. 
There should be a symbol near the words "public class RedState implements". 
Click on the error symbol; a small box should appear with a couple options to
fix the problem. Select <i>Add unimplemented methods</i>. Eclipse will generate 
<i>method stubs</i> for you, but since it can't possibly know what the methods 
are supposed to do, the implementation will do nothing. Double-click on the 
RedState class to open up the code editor<br><br>

Inside the <i>getColor</i> method, put:<br>
<i>return java.awt.Color.red</i>;<br><br>
Inside the <i>getNextState</i> method, put:<br>
<i>return new GreenState</i>();<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close the code window. You'll want to repeat that entire procedure for the 
<i>GreenState</i> class, substituting <i>java.awt.Color.green</i> and 
<i>RedState</i> where appropriate.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We need to set an initial state for our traffic light. Open up the 
<i>TrafficLight</i> class and change the code in the constructor to match the 
following. This code will be executed when a new <i>TrafficLight</i> is created:
<br><br>

<table style="width: 100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody>
  <tr><td style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192)">
    public TrafficLight() {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_myState = new RedState();<br>
    }
  </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the &quot;Package Explorer&quot; view, click on <i>Runner.java</i> and select 
<i>Run -&gt; Run As -&gt; Java Application</i> from the menu at the top. A 
window should appear with a red box. Click on the box; you should observe it 
change from red to green. If you click again, it will go from green to red. If 
you're feeling ambitious, try adding a yellow light in.
