Meeting on July 17, 2006

	Present: Brian McSkimming, Adrienne & Carl
	
Accomplishments:
	RC3 branch has been advanced to include the commits completed on 3/30/06. This includes:
		Enum Support
		New Relationship Visitors
		Filter Fix
		Resize Fix
		999999 Bug Fix
		Quick Fix
		
A fair amount of discussion regarding the following design thoughts:
	Open New Diagram should be renamed "Create New" Diagram
	Would it be possible to nest Create New Diagram within the "New" context menu
	Green Icons need to be revamped, possibilities include:
		the green "g" within a file, similiar to the "J" within a java file
		the green "g" within a mini-uml box, if it would be noticible as such
		a file, similiar to the java icon, only instead of a "j" within it, the entire
		  file could be colored green
	Possible change of file extension name from ".dia" to either ".green" or ".uml"
	
It was noticed that in order to properly use Incremental Exploration of relationships,
that the java librairies need to be properly attached within Eclipse.  (NOTE: This was
supposedly fixed (read: ignored) in a later update of green, according to commit comments)

Goals:
	Continue advancement of green through time, in an attempt to bring it to the point 
	when Blake left, only without the memory leak.
