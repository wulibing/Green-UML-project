Meeting on July 10, 2006

	Present: Brian McSkimming, Gene Wang, Adrienne & Carl
	
Accomplishment:
	Green has been rolled back to RC2, and stored in the repository as two seperate 
	branches, RC2 & RC3.
	
It has been recogonized that developer level design documents are needed, and that work
should begin on those. This includes green's interactions with GEF, the eclipse framework,
and so on.

RC2 concerns -- On Generalization and Realization relationships, the cardinality is being
requested when it shouldn't be.  This was edited and corrected during the meeting.

Goals:
	-- Get all bugs currently known, as well as feature requests listed on Sourceforge.
	-- Continue development and advancement of the RC3 branch in an attempt to bring it up
	   to the point when Blake left, only without the massive memory leak.
	-- Update the website to include a more meaningful main page, as well as additional
	   download links and a documentation section
	-- Enum Support
