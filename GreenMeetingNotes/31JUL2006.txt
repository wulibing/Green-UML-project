Meeting on July 31, 2006

	Present: Brian McSkimming, Gene Wang, Adrienne & Carl
	
Accomplishments:
	Green has been advanced without any obvious slow down to the point of last remaining 
	updates within the CVS repository.
	
Goals necessary for the release of RC3:
	Incremental Explorer needs to be removed from the diagram editor itself.  -- DONE bmm 7/31
	Green icon needs to be incorporated into a file icon. (As per Adrienne's request...) -- DONE bmm 8/1
	Removal of String class from diagram is "decrementally deleted", and needs to be properly 
	  removed in one fell swoop.
    Exception errors when dealing with static inner classes (listed in ErrorWithLRStructPackages)
    
New developments noted through Carl's laptop of misfortune:

*** This should also be fixed for the release of RC3

	No more handles error caused in SWT -- Could be a problem due to the Dispose() method not 
	being called properly at the close and opening of editor windows (this is in 
	reference to a bug log on eclipse.org)
