SF Number:
Date Submitted: 12-01-07			Completed: 01-27-08
Delegated to: Josh, Brian			Forecast: Short

Description:
While we had a lovely system of physical cards, it was deemed that we had no idea where
they hid them when they moved our stuff, so an electronic card system was needed.  Not that
We'd have anything to put there at the moment.

Possible Solutions:
Bugzilla, .txt files in CVS, other free bug trackers

Work to Date:
Brian determines that the higher ups are indifferent to our plight, bugzilla is out. 01-22-08
Josh builds a .txt set up in CVS.  Effort is minimal. 01-27-08
