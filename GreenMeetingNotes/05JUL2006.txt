	User Manual - (Gene)
		Working on HTML docs
		To tag/branch the docs to keep them in synch with
			tagging/branching of corresponding code
		Must ensure that docs posted on sourceforge correspond
			to the docs in release
		
	RC2 versions of files identified
		To be tagged and set as main branch
		Anything past RC2 must be tagged as the RC3 branch
		Create 2 branches alongside the HEAD
			one to be used to recover an RC2, which won't be modified
			one to be used to create an RC2 base which will become RC3
		Once 2.5 is released, 2.5 will be merged with HEAD.
