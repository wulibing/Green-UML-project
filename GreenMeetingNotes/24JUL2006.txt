Accomplishments:

		Fixed appearance of wizard
		Restructed element wizards
		Javadoc additions
		Editor automatically refreshed after command is executed
		Debugging Fixed --> Root Menu causing problem
		Prevented error from method parameter names not being available (e.g. no available
		  source)
		Workaround for bendpoint location saving bug
		Made type validity checked plugin-orientated
		Changed automatic generation of fields to manual
		Added ability to use preferred prefix when generating variable names
	Work on design documentation
	

-- It was noticed that Sourceforge is still not sending any bug notices to development
   team members.  It appears that only if one chooses to monitor a bug, or creates 
   that bug do any updates get sent to a team member.  
-- Static methods are being initially ignored with regards to relationships, however upon
   refreshing the diagram they are being displayed.  This seems like they are being created
   and added to the diagram, and being ignored initially, however from a design perspective
   perhaps they should not be added to the diagram at all. 

Goals:
	-- Continue advancement of RC3 to the final updates, ending on 5/10/06.  There appear 
	   to only be 4 major commits up to that point.
	-- Repair the Debug: The majority of tests either fail or error out.  This may be a 
	   result of the project not being at its final commited state, however the tests were
	   returned to THEIR final commited state, so everything should pass, yet none do.
	-- Change default relationship line width to the far left option, as the dotted lines
	   are noticable as dotted lines.
	-- Research the static method bug referenced earlier, and added to Sourceforge during
	   the meeting.
