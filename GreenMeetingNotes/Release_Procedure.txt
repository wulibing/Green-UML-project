*In Eclipse
  - Go to File -> Export...
  - Under "Select an export destination...", choose
    "Plug-in Development" -> "Deployable plug-ins and fragments"
  - Click Next
  - Check the box next to all Plug-ins for release.  i.e.
      edu.buffalo.cse.green
      edu.buffalo.cse.green.help
      edu.buffalo.cse.green.relationship.association
      edu.buffalo.cse.green.relationship.composition
      edu.buffalo.cse.green.relationship.dependency
      edu.buffalo.cse.green.relationship.generalization
      edu.buffalo.cse.green.relationship.realization
    Note: at this point, we do not release edu.buffalo.cse.green.debug
    Note: the end of each plug-in will include additional version numbers
  - Choose a directory under the Directory tab
  - Under Options, select "Include source code" if it it source version
    Otherwise, leave all three checkboxes blank
    Note: do this export twice, once including the source, once without it
  - Click Finish

  - Go to File -> Export... again
  - Under "Select an export destination...", choose
    "General" -> "File System"
  - Click Next
  - In the Green project, select the entire "icons" directory
  - For "To directory:" navigate to the directory you used to export
    the Plug-ins, then to /plugins/edu.buffalo.cse.green
  - Under Options, do not check "Overwrite existing files..." and
    select the "Create only selected directories" radio button.  These
    should be the default values anyway.
  - Click Finish
    Note: icons needed to be exported manually because Eclipse does not 
          consider them to be a part of the plugin code

*Zip up the directory that was created. (Via WinZip, WinRAR, etc.)

*After logging in to SourceForge
  - Go to Admin -> File Releases
  - Click [Add Release] for the package named "green"
  - Name the release and click on "Create release"
  - Follow the steps provided by SourceForge
    Note: For Step 2, you will need an independent FTP client, e.g.
          FileZilla to upload the files.
    Note: For Step 3, mark the files "Platform-Independent" for Processor
          and mark "Source .zip" and ".zip" for File Type accordingly.
          Be sure to hit "Update/Refresh" for each.
