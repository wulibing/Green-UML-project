2.5.0 Release Plan

	Bugs to be fixed

		- Eclipse integration
OK		  = .dia files: "Open with ..." > "Green (UML class diagram editor)"
OK		  = add "New..." > "Green UML class diagram" --> wizard for save location?
		    should also tie into File->New (with ICON!)
OK		  = remove the "Open new UML class diagram"

Done[Nov08.06]Brian  FOR .java files, packages, and Java projects
			  = "Green..." > "Add to last viewed class diagram"
			  = "Green..." > "Add to new class diagram"

Done[Nov08.06]Brian  FOR .class files, packages, and Java projects
			  = "Green..." > "Add to last viewed class diagram"
			  = "Green..." > "Add to new class diagram"
			  
OK		  FOR .dia files --> just regular open
		  
		  In diagram context menu
OK		  	 Done bmm  = "Print class diagram"
		  The following are folded into the "Save as...", in keeping
		  with Windows conventions:
		  	  = "Export as image..." > "jpeg"
		  	  = "Export as image..." > "gif"
Done[Nov08.06]Brian = "Save/Save As..."

Done[Nov08.06]Brian = remove "Filters..."

Done[Nov08.06]Brian = keep other context menu items - interpret this in context :-)
		  	  
Done[Nov30.06]Brian - In toolbar, use standard icons (e.g. redo, undo, ...) rather than words.
			Now these are in their own Menu bar, and much more discrete.  Plus the normal
			Print icon lights up when our editor is selected.

Done[Oct06.06]Gene: for some reason, in workspace saves were limited to .dia types only 
			this limitation was removed - jpeg save-as issue
			saving within workspace doesn't work
Done[Oct06.06]Gene - change hovers over "class" "interface" "enum" and "note" to remove
			"diagram"

CHECKED UP TO HERE ON APR.03.07

Done[Oct06.06]Gene - In docs, remove (*) for new items.
	   		= in Eclipse plug-in
	   		= on SourceForge
Done[Oct06.06]Gene - fixed error with default file name not showing in the save dialog
			when doing Save As...
Done[Oct09.06]Gene - delete: when two Java files are open, deleting the relationship
			removes the code, does not save the java file, and hence does not
			update the diagram [had to do with working copy not being updated]
Done[Oct10.06]Gene - renamed extension to .grn, implemented backwards
			compatibility with .dia's.
			*** back off this change and put into a 3.0 release [DONE]
Done[Oct10.06]Gene: rewrote GIF 8bit converter, it's got a funny color scheme 
			now - gif save-as issue 
			doesn't work properly - if we get it working, make sure docs are updated
			to reflect this
Done[Oct18.06]Brian - Unit Tests are buggy [user error :-) -- Eclipse window must be maximized
			when running the unit tests - very (un)intuitive...]
Done[Jan29.07]Gene - When you try to delete a class from within the diagram, a null pointer
            exception is thrown.
Done[Feb27.07]Brian/Gene: The PREFERENCE to auto-generate constructor stubs from
       	    superclass SHOULD cause the "generate constructors from superclass" option
            in class creation dialog box to be checked by default; unchecking it should
            cause the option to be unchecked in the class creation dialog box by default.
            Underlying problem: settings file for New Class Wizard not being accessed
            properly.
Done[Feb28.07]Gene: Added two more preferences (in addition to the constructor
            preference which we just added), to set a default value for the class
            creation dialog.
              - inherit abstract methods (default checked)
              - add main method (default unchecked)
Done[Apr06.07]Gene - removed separator between context menu items 

CHECKED UP TO HERE ON APR.17.07

Done[May18.07]All - Getting Help section
		  = FAQ (installation problems (no GEF), how do I save as JPG,...)
		    - Make sure Java 1.5 is used by Eclipse to load the plug-in
		  = Help in Eclipse
		  	  = clean up TOC organization
		  	  = make page for contents of Help, not just one big file
		  	  = review contents for correctness/completeness/clarity
		  	  = add a section background/philosophy of Green
			  = Info about how to subscribe to GREEN-DISCUSS-LIST
		            submit a bug report
		            make a feature request
		            contact development team
		            vote on EPIC, comment on EPIC
		            add link to Green's sourceforge site
		      = Update screen shots

Done[May18.07]Gene - the Green code generation taps into the code behavior specified in Eclipse.
			By going to Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style, prefixes/suffixes can be defined
			by the user which in turn is taken into consideration by Green when generating
			the appropriate variables.
			- generated instance variable names should have "_" at front (perhaps make prefix
			string an option)
			- What was thought to once be done is not as such.  -- needs to tie in Eclipse's 
			preference into green so that when creating a field through a diagram, it takes
			said preference into account
			- all variable creation should now take into account the Eclipse preferences through
			edu.buffalo.cse.green.preferences.VariableAffix
			- Add default prefix to name section in new field dialog before user types in name
     
Note: Do NOT put '>' or '<' in text of notes.
